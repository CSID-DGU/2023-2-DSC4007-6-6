Pytorch version of - https://github.com/WaqasSultani/AnomalyDetectionCVPR2018

This project is highly inspired by [ekosman/AnomalyDetectionCVPR2018-Pytorch](https://github.com/ekosman/AnomalyDetectionCVPR2018-Pytorch)

Our work mainly focuses on...
- minimizing the size of the feature-extraction/prediciton model so that it can fit in a single board computer such as a raspberry pi
- fitting the dataset into our target environment (which is korean safety statistics)
