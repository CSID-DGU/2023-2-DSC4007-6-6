Pytorch version of - https://github.com/WaqasSultani/AnomalyDetectionCVPR2018

This project is highly inspired by [https://github.com/ekosman/AnomalyDetectionCVPR2018-Pytorch](ekosman/AnomalyDetectionCVPR2018-Pytorch).

Our work mainly focuses on minimizing the prediciton model so that it can fit in a single board computer such as a raspberry pi.
